Deployments and Pods are two Kubernetes different objects. A Deployment manages creating Pods by means of ReplicaSets. 

In other words, a Kubernetes Deployment is used to instruct the Kubernetes API to create or modify pods.

Deployments manages pods by :

- Scaling the number of their replica
- Enable rollout of newer versions
- Roll back to an earlier Deployment version
